 *
 * IMPORTANT: These values are derived from real upload costs:
 * - Actual cost per MB: ~0.03-0.04 WAL (measured from production uploads)
 * - Previous formula was off by 200-300x, requiring massive safety buffers
 *
 * Real-world measurement (Jan 2025):
 * - 2 segments (~1 MB total) with "both" encryption = 0.0594 WAL total
 * - Per upload: ~0.0297 WAL for ~0.5 MB = ~0.06 WAL/MB
 * - This includes erasure coding expansion and all Walrus fees
